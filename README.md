# Explanation: 
This file is where I log my crypto mining withdrawals. I thought it would be both fun and useful to know how much money I've earned 
and how much money I've invested in order to pinpoint when I'll break even. 

It started off as just a log for my withdrawals, then I realized I could also log the money I've invested so I can calculate my net income. 
I then decided to go even further by calculating the average earnings per month, and even calculating the estimated time left for me to break
even on my initial investment. Although this sheet is pretty simple,  it involved gathering data, entering it, visualizing it, and also finding
a way to make it useful by calculating my break even point. I was happy to apply lots of the skills I've learned as a data analyst into a hobby of mine!
