# Explanation: 
This file is where I log my crypto mining withdrawals. I thought it would be both fun and useful to know how much money I've earned 
and how much money I've invested in order to pinpoint when I'll break even. 

It started off as just a log for my withdrawals, then I realized I could also log the money I've invested so I can calculate my net income. 
I then decided to go even further by calculating the average earnings per month, and even calculating the estimated time left for me to break
even on my initial investment. Although this sheet is pretty simple,  it involved gathering data, entering it, visualizing it, and also finding
a way to make it useful by calculating my break even point. I was happy to apply lots of the skills I've learned as a data analyst into a hobby of mine!

# How was the estimated break-even date calculated?: 
To find the date at which I break even on my investment, I calculated the earnings of every month, and then found the average earnings per month. 
The earnings of October were a significant outlier because I had a lot more equipment at the time, so I calculated the average earnings per month
excluding October, and decided that figure would be a better representation of my average monthly earnings. 

I then made a formula where I multiplied the net earnings by -1, and divided them by the average earnings per month (excluding October). This gave me
the amount of months left to break even. I then  used the EDATE formula to add the amount of months to the current date, giving me 3/8/2022 as my
break-even date. 

# Disclosure
All of this mining was done on Nicehash. Long story short, even though my computers are being used to mine Ethereum, I get paid in Bitcoin. This 
complicates predictions because the break-even date is affected by the price of not one, but two different crypocurrencies. The break-even date 
found is true explicitly if all factors remain constant, but that is not going to be the case. The break-even point can come sooner or later than predicted, 
but it gives us a decent time frame on when to expect to break even.
